Semiconductor Quality Prediction with Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a semiconductor product will pass or fail quality testing based on real-world sensor data.

The goal of this project is to explore how predictive analytics can be used in manufacturing and to practice handling imbalanced datasets with modern ML methods.



🚀 Key Highlights

Predictive Modeling: Built a classification model using Random Forest.

Data Balancing: Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

High Accuracy: Achieved 99.06% accuracy on the dataset.

Data Insights: Explored feature importance to identify the most critical sensors.




🛠️ Tech Stack
